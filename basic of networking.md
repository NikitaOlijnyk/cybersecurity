An IP address (Internet Protocol address) is a unique identifier assigned to each device connected to a network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication. It allows devices to send and receive data across the network.

-IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4) uses a 32-bit address space, allowing for around 4.3 billion unique addresses. It is written in dotted decimal format (e.g., 192.168.1.1).

-IPv6 (version 6) was introduced to solve the shortage of IPv4 addresses. It uses 128-bit addresses, allowing for an almost infinite number of unique addresses. Itâ€™s written in hexadecimal and separated by colons (e.g., 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334).
